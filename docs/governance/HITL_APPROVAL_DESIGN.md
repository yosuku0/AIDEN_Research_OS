# HITL_APPROVAL_DESIGN

## Purpose

Human approval nodes sit before merge, phase gate, allowlist, capital, release, hard-ban, and authority changes. Actions are approve, edit, reject, hold. Timeout becomes Hold. Emergency kill switch creates incident-record before resume.

## Boundary

This artifact is part of the AIDEN Research OS research/control-plane scaffold. It grants no signing, deployment, capital, allowlist, release, wallet, swap, bridge, transfer, or production-write authority.
